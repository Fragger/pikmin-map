## FAQ

Make sure to understand [how this map works](#about)

### This map displays a decoration that does not appear on my detector

- OSM may be returning a location that didn't exist the last time the data was retrieved by the game servers.
- Perhaps this map uses a tag that isn't actually used in the game (We're doing our best not to let that happen. If you think it has, leave us a message!).

### My detector displays a decoration that does not appear on this map

- The game may be displaying a location that has since been removed from OSM.
- The game may be displaying a location from Foursquare (this map only uses OSM locations)
